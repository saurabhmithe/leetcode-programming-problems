    /*

    Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.

    Example:
    Input: [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
    Output: 4
    Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.

    Note:
    There may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.
    Your algorithm should run in O(n2) complexity.
    Follow up: Could you improve it to O(n log n) time complexity?
